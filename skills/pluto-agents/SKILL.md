# pluto-agents

## Do

- Use typed run dependencies for verified identity, tenant scope and application services.
- Register tools explicitly; narrow the allowed tool set per run and enforce policy at the execution boundary.
- Bind tools to declared managed operations. Tool adapters decode typed inputs and call the same gate used by HTTP/workers; private authored operation code owns orchestration. Do not add an alternate business `Handle` callback or reproduce gate logic in a tool.
- Obtain caller/delegation evidence from the supported verifier and exact trusted issuer. A model-supplied actor, tenant, resource label or copied role snapshot cannot create authority.
- Wrap external API tools in the same permission/resource boundaries; keep destinations and credentials server-controlled.
- Candidate write tools require host-owned approval and operation idempotency. Bind the approved intent to the exact identity, gate, resource and normalized input/key; model arguments cannot issue or widen that approval.
- Test with scripted providers and HTTP mocks first; verify denied runs make zero external calls.
- Exercise direct tool invocation, mismatched/expired authority and restricted writes after the run ends. A tool-level permission check does not replace resource policy or the operation's required gate.

## Don't

- Do not let the model select its authority, role, credentials or arbitrary outbound destinations.
- Do not describe token accounting as a hard billing cap or cooperative cancellation as guaranteed interruption.
- Do not promise durable recovery or exactly-once execution from in-memory runs/replay guards.
- Do not make live paid model calls unless the user authorized that test.
