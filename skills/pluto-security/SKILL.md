# pluto-security

## Do

- Derive identity from the configured authentication issuer; verify the selected tenant against current server-side membership before creating scoped execution.
- Use the supported identity issuer and bind evidence to that exact issuer. A private type with a public strings-only constructor is not verified authority; reject zero, foreign, expired and revoked evidence.
- Check permissions and resource/tenant ownership in application operations, including calls made outside HTTP.
- Require the same declared gate for HTTP, worker and tool calls. Resource policy is separate from capability permission and must bind the actual resource. Revalidate at restricted writes where the contract requires it.
- Couple scoped execution capabilities to private writer callbacks; do not expose a separate unrestricted write after a successful check. Capability lifetime does not make revocation atomic with SQL.
- Use published Pluto Auth credential flows and the configured Origin, limiter and delivery boundaries.
- Use Core feature evaluation; preserve explicit false overrides and expose only declared client-visible flags in caller context.
- Keep security middleware enabled; apply explicit migrations and test cross-tenant and denied-access cases.

## Don't

- Do not accept roles, tenant authority or permissions from request/model arguments.
- Do not trust a queued actor ID, an agent dependency's label, or a fabricated principal as proof of identity. Use verified delegation/service authority with explicit scope and purpose.
- Do not substitute a feature flag or hidden frontend control for authorization.
- Do not cache credential responses, log secrets or store session credentials in browser storage.
- Do not grant business membership during public enrollment or expose development issuance routes in production.
