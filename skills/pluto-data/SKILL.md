# pluto-data

## Do

- Use PostgreSQL and sqlc query boundaries; include tenant predicates in every scoped read/write.
- Consume authority from the operation's verified scope/resource boundary. Ordinary tenant strings, request payloads and cached membership do not establish authority.
- Keep lifecycle state private to its domain owner. Transition writes require the owning machine's evaluated decision and expected version; reject zero, foreign, expired or differently bound authority before effects.
- Commit business changes, expected-version checks, durable audit records and outbox enqueue in the same transaction when required.
- Use Core bounded pagination and bind cursors to the query context.
- Apply resource visibility and tenant predicates in the query before pagination. Exports use an explicit bound and the same visibility contract; filtering an unrestricted page afterward is incorrect.
- Use the same-transaction idempotency API when a business write and replay completion must be atomic.
- Make job handlers safe under at-least-once delivery; scope cache keys by app, environment and tenant.
- Authorize before every cache access, including hits. Keep key/TTL/loading mechanics in a scoped data adapter; operations receive its restricted port. Cache invalidation and object delivery are not database rollback guarantees.
- Validate and normalize domain values once at controlled constructors. Define typed effect payloads; enqueue declared delivery with the mutation and bound retries at the worker.
- Test transaction rollback, competing writes, duplicate delivery and tenant isolation with real backing services where relevant.

## Don't

- Do not use a cursor, cache entry or idempotency key as authorization.
- Do not claim generic HTTP replay capture is atomic with the business write, or jobs provide exactly-once delivery.
- Do not use memory stores as durable production storage or silently retry uncertain writes without reconciliation.
- Do not make a cache authoritative for sessions, permissions or business correctness.
- Do not count a skipped database case, build failure, missing test or unrelated error as negative proof. Require the expected business assertion and an allowed positive control.
