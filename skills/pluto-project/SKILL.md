# pluto-project

## Do

- Read `pluto.toml`, local agent instructions and `pluto version` before changing a project.
- Use the CLI for project/frontend initialization, endpoints, jobs, agents, state machines, components and auth UI. Inspect help/`--dry-run`; use explicit arguments with `--no-input`.
- Generate first; implement business logic in authored extension points. Edit manifest-owned metadata in `pluto.toml`, then regenerate.
- Declare operation authority and behavior before choosing its HTTP, worker or tool entry. Use the installed CLI's supported references; unsupported contracts require an explicit framework upgrade, not a handwritten alternate gate.
- Persist generator choices in `pluto.toml`; load secrets through the configured environment/provider.
- Keep the application environment prefix explicit, uppercase and scoped to the app.
- After the final edit, run `pluto fmt`, `pluto vet` and relevant tests. For frontend edits, run its format/lint/check scripts. Fix findings; rerun affected checks.
- Report checks run, failures and missing tools. Do not claim incomplete validation passed.

## Feature rollout

- Gate unfinished/staged capabilities behind declared, default-off flags before merging. Routine fixes/refactors need no flag unless rollout requires one.
- Use `pluto add endpoint ... --feature <key>` for gated routes; add `--feature-client-visible` only when needed by UI. Use Core evaluation inside operations.
- Gate server behavior before side effects; retain authorization. Test both states, including no new effects while disabled. Define when to remove the flag.

## Don't

- Do not hand-create supported scaffolds or patch generated output to bypass the CLI. Resolve/report missing or failing tooling; use documented extension points for unsupported work.
- Do not suppress lint rules, shrink tests or skip checks to make a change pass.
- Do not overwrite authored files or migrate old scaffold schemas implicitly.
- Do not commit real secrets or assume generated development integrations are production-ready.
- Do not add dependencies when an existing Pluto primitive covers the need.
- Keep candidate local replacements explicit and isolated from release pins. A passing candidate consumer is not proof that published dependencies contain its APIs.
